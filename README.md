# Ensolvers Technical Test - TODO Application - Fullstack Trainee

This project is a technical test for the company Ensolvers. The application is a basic TODO with a backend built in NestJS, a PostgreSQL database, and the frontend developed with Vite and React.

## Quick Start

1. **Installation:**
    - Ensure that PostgreSQL is installed on your system.
    - Run the following script to start the project:
    

    ```bash
    pnpm run dev
    ```

    This will install dependencies, configure the database, and run both the backend and frontend.

2. **Accessing the Application:**
    - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5173` to see the frontend in action.

    **Note:**
    - The backend is configured at `http://localhost:3000`.
    - The frontend is configured at `http://localhost:5173`.

3. **Requirements:**
    - Make sure to have PostgreSQL installed locally, as the application utilizes a database to store information.
